                        We are a bunch of teens who believe that no matter how much we impose the idea of social media being a bad influence on all of us, it is essential to understand the importance of it at the same time during such critical times. So, we aim to reach out to all the adults and children out there to aid us in our objective of highlighting both how advantageous and disadvantageous social media is to our daily lives.

                        We firmly believe that even though it is a good practice to make people aware about social media, we also believe that people do not believe what they do not see. In order to prove that people are still not aware of the perfect practices on how to handle social media, we request you all to take part in our intesively built surveys and see the result for yourselves through intergrated charts.

                            I started posting music covers on a social media platform i.e Instagram since last year and I've still been posting different genres in different ways reels(15 and 30 seconds ), One-minute covers and IGTV (long covers). By tagging famous creators/artists/celebrities to watch our content and reshare so that people can get to know more about our talent and quality of content we post. I will keep posting and being active on social media doing my bit for myself as well as the society in the hope for love , fame and respect.

                            Social media for me has been really beneficial as i recently made an edits account names @she.who.edits and this was a way for me to use my editing skills. my edits recieved a lot of views on instagram, just recently one of my reels hit 5.5 million. this all was very huge and unexpected for me. I got a lot of dms regarding my editing skills and someone even offered to pay me which is amazing as someone can make sure to showcase their talent through instagram and people actually take it seriously.

                             I always believed art to be a form of relief for me and place where I can let go of my emotions through colours and strokes, but as I started posting and sharing more of it, I realised how much it can connect everyone, how people feel the same things I do and how this connectedness comes through with these posts. A simple comment, one tap on this tiny screen brought the biggest change and inspired me to create every single day. Through this I have realised that it may be the smallest action but it makes the biggest difference.
